# Introduction to Blockchain and Ethereum
Throughout the course, we will walk you through a detailed step-by-step process to create and develop an advanced smart contract with different complexity levels and hurdles. Each lesson will teach you just enough about ethereum to be productive right away. You will learn how tokenization works, how to think in decentralized way, and build blockchain-based distributed computing systems. You will build interesting projects with ethereum such as wallets, copyrights, secure data sharing, and more.By the end of this course, you will be able to tackle blockchain challenges by implementing end-to-end projects.


## What you will learn
* Grasp blockchain concepts such as private and public keys, addresses, wallets, and hashes
* Send and analyze transactions in the Ethereum Rinkeby test network
* Compile and deploy your own ERC20-compliant smart contracts and tokens
* Test your smart contracts using MyEtherWallet
* Create a distributed web interface for your contract
* Combine Solidity and JavaScript to create your very own decentralized application



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher, preferably multi-core
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 10GB or more
* System with DirectX 9 or higher (1024 x 768 or higher resolution)
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher)
* [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/)
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/)
